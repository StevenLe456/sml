This repository contains notes and code based on the book *Statistical Machine Learning: A Unified Framework* by Richard M. Golden.
These resources can be used for the following classes at the University of Texas at Dallas:
* CS/CGS 4314 - Intelligent Systems Analysis
* CS/CGS 4315 - Intelligent Systems Design
* ACN/HCS 6348 - Neural Net Mathemtics
* ACN/HCS 6349 - Statistical Machine Learning

## Dependencies

The only softwares needed to use this resource is Python > 3.8 and an IDE to run and view the Jupyter notebooks.

## How to Use

1. Download the whole repository into a zip file using the green button at the very top and selecting **Download ZIP**.
